8/3/2017,Hotel Arena, Russia , I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,52.3605759,4.9159683

7/31/2017,Hotel Arena, Australia , Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge ,52.3605759,4.9159683
7/31/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,52.3605759,4.9159683
7/24/2017,Hotel Arena, New Zealand , You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again ,52.3605759,4.9159683

6/30/2017,Hotel Arena, Ireland , We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment ,52.3605759,4.9159683

6/20/2017,Hotel Arena, Australia , We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,52.3605759,4.9159683

6/12/2017,Hotel Arena, France , Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,52.3605759,4.9159683
6/10/2017,Hotel Arena, Germany , Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing ,52.3605759,4.9159683

5/25/2017,Hotel Arena, United States of America , The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,52.3605759,4.9159683
5/25/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all ,52.3605759,4.9159683
5/22/2017,Hotel Arena, France , Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you ,52.3605759,4.9159683
5/21/2017,Hotel Arena, United States of America , We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom ,52.3605759,4.9159683

4/20/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that,52.3605759,4.9159683
4/19/2017,Hotel Arena, Canada , Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet ,52.3605759,4.9159683
4/18/2017,Hotel Arena, Germany , Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy ,52.3605759,4.9159683
4/16/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate ,52.3605759,4.9159683
4/14/2017,Hotel Arena, Switzerland , Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again ,52.3605759,4.9159683

4/5/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,52.3605759,4.9159683
3/29/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups ,52.3605759,4.9159683

3/20/2017,Hotel Arena, United Kingdom , The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam ,52.3605759,4.9159683

2/6/2017,Hotel Arena, Malaysia , The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management ,52.3605759,4.9159683

10/24/2016,Hotel Arena, France , Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,52.3605759,4.9159683
